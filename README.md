# Nordnet nExt Scala Client

A start of a Scala client for the Swedish bank Nordnet's trading API. After seeing how the certificate price had been raised to 1000 kr per month, I lost the motivation to finish the client. 
However, I am leaving it here in case someone might find it interesting. At least I was able to learn about Http4s.
